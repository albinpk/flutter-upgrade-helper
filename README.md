## 🎯 Why This Tool?

Upgrading Flutter projects often introduces changes across:
- `android/`
- `ios/`
- `web/`
- `windows/`
- `linux/`
- `macos/`
- `pubspec.yaml`
- Configuration files and build scripts

Manually comparing versions is time-consuming and error-prone.

**Flutter Upgrade Helper automates this process** by generating version diffs instantly.
